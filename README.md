# Design Patterns Project

---

This project is a collection of implementations of various design patterns in Kotlin and Java. Each design pattern is implemented in its own module, and each module contains a README.md file that provides a detailed explanation of the design pattern and its implementation.  

## Table of Contents

- Factory Design Pattern
- Prototype Design Pattern
- Builder Design Pattern
- Singleton Design Pattern

## Factory Design Pattern

The Factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. This pattern is particularly useful when a class cannot anticipate the class of objects it needs to create.  For more details, please refer to the Factory README.md.  

## Prototype Design Pattern

The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows an object to create a clone of itself. This pattern is particularly useful when the creation of a new object is costly and you want to avoid the cost of creation when you need a duplicate object.  For more details, please refer to the Prototype README.md.  

## Builder Design Pattern

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows for the step-by-step creation of complex objects using the correct sequence of actions. The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.  For more details, please refer to the Builder README.md.  

Singleton Design Pattern
The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to it. This pattern is particularly useful when exactly one instance of a class is required to control actions.  For more details, please refer to the Singleton README.md.
